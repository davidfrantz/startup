- add $HOME/bin to $PATH
- set UMASK for collaborative use as a team
- display how much space is left on disks you want to monitor
- display if there are active screens present
- set some aliase for FORCE etc.
- check if you can run Docker containers
- add a launcher for Dockerized QGIS in a screen


## Attention

A new `$HOME/.profile` is installed. Make a backup of yours, if necessary.
